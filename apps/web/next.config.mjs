/**
 * Next 16 ships Turbopack as default for dev. The web workspace has no
 * native module deps (better-sqlite3 lives in apps/api only), so Turbopack
 * is safe here. The api still runs on Node 26 + better-sqlite3 12 directly.
 *
 * Web is UI-only. All data calls go through /v1/* which Next rewrites to
 * apps/api on :3540. Same-origin in dev; in prod a reverse proxy serves the
 * same paths.
 *
 * Routing decisions:
 *   - `/v1/*`, `/health`            → proxied to apps/api on :3540.
 *   - everything else               → Next.js App Router. `/portal/*` is the
 *                                     real production UI (TypeScript +
 *                                     react-query); `/` redirects there via
 *                                     `apps/web/app/page.tsx`.

/**
 * BUILD NOTE — the `build` script passes `--experimental-build-mode compile`.
 * Next.js 16 (all versions through 16.3 canary) crashes while statically
 * prerendering its internal `/_not-found` and `/_global-error` pages with
 * "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')" inside the framework's
 * OuterLayoutRouter — an unresolved upstream bug (vercel/next.js #85668, #86178,
 * #84994) that is bundler-, React-version- and config-independent and cannot be
 * worked around from application code. `compile` mode skips the static-generate
 * phase; this portal is 100% dynamic (every route is `ƒ` server-rendered on
 * demand, all data flows through /v1), so nothing is lost. Revisit once Next
 * ships a fix and drop the flag to restore the standard build.
