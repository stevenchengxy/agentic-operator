/**
 * Pixel-diff harness for the App Router portal.
 *
 * Captures a 1440×900 screenshot of each of the 9 nav views and compares
 * it against a stored reference under `./v1_1-reference/<view>.png` with
 * a 0.1 % pixel-diff tolerance (FR-PORT-3).
 *
 * Reference images are checked in once and treated as the
 *   "design-locked" baseline. Re-generating requires an explicit
 *   `--update-snapshots` invocation by a human reviewer.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   - Each view runs in its own `test()` so a single drift doesn't
 *     blast the whole suite.
 *   - We wait on `networkidle` to give SSE / TanStack hydration a
 *     chance to paint. The dashboard's event ticker is animated; we
 *     freeze it by setting `reducedMotion=reduce` AND injecting a
 *     CSS rule that pauses every animation.
 *   - Auth: the portal is gated. Tests sign in through the real password
 *     form using the explicitly configured bootstrap administrator.
