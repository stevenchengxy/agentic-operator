/*
 * Vitest config for the Next.js web workspace.
 *
 * Coverage gate (P4-TEST-07): lines >= 70%, branches >= 60% over the
 * unit-testable surface.
 *
 * Coverage scope notes:
 *   - The legacy v1_1 SPA under public/portal is served via CDN
 *     React + Babel-standalone; it has no module graph and isn't reached
 *     by Vitest at all. It's explicitly excluded so the coverage report
 *     reflects only TSX code we actually own.
 *   - Next.js app routes (app/.../page.tsx, layout.tsx) are exercised
 *     end-to-end via Playwright (P4-TEST-04, P4-TEST-05). Putting them
 *     under the unit-coverage gate would either reward shallow snapshot
 *     tests or force a SSR test-harness this codebase deliberately
 *     doesn't carry. Pure helpers (app/portal/lib, plus the
 *     app/portal/components helpers with .test.ts siblings) stay in
 *     scope.
