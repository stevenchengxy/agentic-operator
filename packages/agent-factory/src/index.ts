// @agentic/agent-factory — the autonomous agent-generation factory, migrated from
// the OLD single-app repo into the new monorepo (see migration-report).
//
// Migration status (M1-b in progress): pure, dependency-free logic is ported first.
// Done so far:
//   - egress-guard       SSRF / egress guard for AI-reachable outbound HTTP
//   - spec-types         GeneratedAgentSpec / IoField / ValidationReport / GenEvent …
//   - ontology-types     OntologyAction / OntologyEvent / DomainOntology …
//   - graph              compile + statically verify the event-orchestration graph
//   - contract           assemble Agent/Event contracts + reconcile payload fields
//   - ports              the 4 injected ports (the migration keystone — DI surface)
// Next (M1-c): port the brain (conductor + stream-gateway + tools) against `ports`,
// then M2 implements the ports for the new apps/api + wires the SSE route + UI tab.
// Until then the fully-working factory still runs in the OLD repo.
