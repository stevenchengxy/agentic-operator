// The injected PORTS that decouple the brain from the OLD repo's concrete
// infrastructure (Prisma/Postgres, Inngest dynamic createFunction, Neo4j/Allmeta).
//
// This is the keystone of the migration. The conductor + tools will depend ONLY on
// these interfaces; each runtime provides a concrete implementation:
//   - the OLD app  → Neo4j/Allmeta + dynamic createFunction + Postgres tables
//   - the NEW apps/api → manifest JSON (models/<tenant>/) + manifest-import + Drizzle
//
// Defining the ports up-front (M1-b) is what lets M1-c port the conductor without
// dragging Prisma/Inngest/Neo4j along, and lets M2/M3 implement deploy + storage for
// the new architecture behind a stable surface. Signatures are the migration's
// design contract; concrete method shapes get finalized as the conductor is ported.
