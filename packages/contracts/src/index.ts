/**
 * @agentic/contracts — shared API request/response Zod schemas.
 *
 * Both apps/api (server) and apps/web (client) import from here. The same
 * schema validates a request on the api side and parses the response on the
 * web side — no client/server type drift.
 *
 * Convention: every resource gets its own file with the route paths,
 * request bodies, query strings, and response shapes co-located.
