/**
 * Workflow manifest migrations.
 *
 * When a breaking schema change ships (rename, enum removal, key deletion),
 * register a migration here that upgrades manifests from version `N` to
 * version `N+1`. `migrate()` chains them so a v1 file is auto-upgraded to
 * `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` at boot, BEFORE `WorkflowManifestSchema.parse`.
 *
 * Why boot-time, not on-disk-rewrite (per CLAUDE.md §Inngest durability):
 *   - Migrations execute before Inngest function registration in
 *     `bootstrapTenant`, so by the time runs replay, the in-memory
 *     manifest is already canonical.
 *   - `agent_versions.manifest_json` stores the migrated snapshot, so
 *     replays use that — never the on-disk file.
 *   - Hand-editing the on-disk file post-deployment never affects
 *     in-flight runs (they're pinned to the snapshot).
 *
 * To add a migration:
 *   1. Bump `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION` below.
 *   2. Add a `MigrationStep` to `MIGRATIONS` that rewrites raw JSON from
 *      `fromVersion` → `fromVersion + 1`.
 *   3. Write a fixture pair under
 *      `apps/api/test/migrations/<from>-to-<to>/{before,expected_after}.json`
 *      and add a test case (TC-34 reserves that slot).
 *
 * Wire format: a manifest file MAY carry `$schemaVersion: <number>` as the
 * first array element wrapped in an object, OR remain a bare array (treated
 * as v1). Always emit `$schemaVersion` after the first save through the editor.
