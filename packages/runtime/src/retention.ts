/**
 * Soft-delete + retention sweep (P1-API-04b).
 *
 * Tombstones (sets `deleted_at`) on rows in `events`, `runs`, `tasks` that are
 * older than the configured retention window. Hard-delete is intentionally
 * separate — the sweep keeps rows queryable through their retention window so
 * compliance + audit can read them; a later vacuum-style step (out of scope
 * for v1) can drop tombstoned rows after a grace period.
 *
 * The sweep is exposed two ways:
 *
 *   1. `runRetentionSweep()` — direct invocation. The API server's nightly
 *      Inngest cron calls this; tests call it inline.
 *
 *   2. `retentionSweepFn` — an Inngest scheduled function that the API
 *      bootstrap registers alongside agent functions. Runs at 03:30 UTC daily.
 *
 * Idempotency: only rows with `deleted_at IS NULL` are considered. Re-running
 * the sweep is a no-op for already-tombstoned rows.
 *
 * Configuration:
 *   - `AGENTIC_RETENTION_DAYS` — events + tasks window (default 30 days).
 *   - `AGENTIC_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS` — RUNS window, governed separately and
 *     **defaulting to 0 (keep runs forever)**. Operators asked that run
 *     monitoring records persist indefinitely and be pruned only by the
 *     user-driven delete/cleanup actions (DELETE /v1/runs). Set a positive
 *     number to re-enable an automatic run sweep. Set either to `0` to disable
 *     that table's auto-tombstoning.
