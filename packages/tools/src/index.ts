/**
 * @agentic/tools — first-party tool implementations + global registry.
 *
 * One production surface:
 *
 *  1. **Global tool registry** (the canonical, configuration-driven surface) —
 *     `globalToolRegistry: Map<string, ToolDescriptor>` and
 *     `listGlobalTools(): ToolCatalogEntry[]` from `./registry`.
 *     Any agent in any tenant can reference these tools by name in its
 *     manifest's `tool_use[]`; no code change needed per tenant. Per-tenant
 *     configuration (API keys, paths) flows through `tool_use[].config`
 *     into `ctx.config`.
 *
 * Unresolved names fail closed in @agentic/runtime. This package deliberately
 * exposes no name-guessing/canned dispatcher: a workflow reports success only
 * after a tenant, global, or MCP handler actually ran.
