/**
 * Integration credential resolver — dependency-injection seam.
 *
 * `@agentic/tools` must stay free of any `@agentic/db` import (it's consumed
 * by the runtime AND, potentially, lighter-weight callers). But DB-backed
 * integrations (configured in Settings → Integrations and persisted to the
 * `integrations` table) need their decrypted base-URL + API-key to reach a
 * tool handler at dispatch time.
 *
 * We solve that the same way the LLM gateway is wired (`setRuntimeGateway`):
 * apps/api injects a resolver at boot that knows how to read + decrypt the
 * tenant's integration row. Tools call `resolveIntegrationCreds(tenantSlug,
 * provider)` and get `{ base_url, api_key }` (or null when nothing is
 * configured), with NO compile-time dependency on the DB.
 *
 * The resolver is synchronous on purpose: the api's store is better-sqlite3
 * (sync) + AES-256-GCM decrypt (sync), so a tool's REST helper can call it
 * inline without turning every credential read into an await.
